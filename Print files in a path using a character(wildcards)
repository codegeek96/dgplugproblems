# Takes a path as input and a charachter and returns a
# output as all the file names starting with that charachter
 
# When a charachter used with * it should return names with multiple occourences of that charchter
# *p means names ending with p
 
# When a charachter used with ? it should return names with single occourences of that charachter
# x? means all those matches starting with x and x occouring only once.
# ?x means all matches ending with x and x occouring only once.
# ?x? means all matches with x in between occouring only once.
